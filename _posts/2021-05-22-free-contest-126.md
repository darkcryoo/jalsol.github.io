[Free Contest 126](https://www.facebook.com/kc97blf/photos/a.1881533165405843/3592513880974421/) has been finished tonight. I got the 18th place, which is fairly normal, although I expected a lot more.<br/>
There are editorial for all the problems, but I feel like I want to explain a bit more.

I couldn't solve **CANDY**, and I almost got **ATRAVEL**. I will explain **ATRAVEL** later.

# LETTERS
**Statement**: A string of size `n` contains `'a'`, `'b'`, or `'?'`. You can replace `'?'` with either `'a'` or `'b'`. After replacing all the `'?'`, for each adjacent pair of characters, we define the following:<br/>

* "aa" = 0
* "ab" = 1
* "bb" = 0
* "ba" = -1

The total value of the string is the sum of values of all adjacent pairs. Find the maximum possible value with the given string.

**Trivia**: I was the second person in the contest to get AC for this problem (the first is [darkkcyan](https://codeforces.com/profile/darkkcyan), the top 1 guy who solved all problems in the contest). Tbh, I don't like the official editorial for this problem.

**Solution**: Let's create a new array called `a`, and assign `a[i]` to `1` if `s[i] == 'a'`, or `0` if otherwise.<br/>
If you calculate the value of the string, it will look something like:<br/>
```
(a[0] - a[1]) + (a[1] - a[2]) + ... + (a[n - 2] - a[n - 1])
```
or, we can rearrange the terms like:
```
a[0] + (-a[1] + a[1]) + (-a[2] + a[2]) + ... + (-a[n - 2] + a[n - 2]) - a[n - 1]
```
Cancelling out the terms, we are left with:
```
a[0] - a[n - 1]
```
Clearly, we only need to care about the first and the last element, and we can safely skip the rest in the middle. Now just check for all possible cases of `s[0]` and `s[n - 1]`, and we are done.

# KPERMS
**Statement**: Given 2 numbers `n` and `k`. Find a permutation of `n` (call it `p`) so that the set of:
```
{ |p[1] - p[2]|, |p[2] - p[3]|, ..., |p[n - 1] - p[n]| }
```
has exactly `k` different elements.

**Trivia**: My solution isn't really as nice as the official one. I kinda wasted some time stress testing before getting one-hit-AC. The official solution solves two base cases: `k = 1` and `k = n - 1`. Then, for general cases, they split it into two parts, one half with `n - k - 1` and one half with `k + 1`, and combine it together.

**Solution**: Let's consider the case of `n = 6, k = 3`. The permutation first looks like `1 2 3 4 5 6`. Now, we only have one unique value, while `k = 3`.<br/>
* If we put `6` after `1` (`1 6 2 3 4 5`), we have 3 unique values.
* If we put `5` after `2` (`1 6 2 5 3 4`), we have 5 unique values.

=> Every time we put `n - i + 1` after `i`, the number of unique values increases by 2.

Now, the number of unique numbers will be odd if we continue this way. But, what if it's even, say, `k = 4`?

Let's look at the permutation where `n = 6, k = 5` (`1 6 2 5 3 4`). The last element that was being moved is `5`. So, reversing all elements after `5` (`1 6 2 5 4 3`) will give us the answer.

# K-NUMBERS
**Statement**: Given an array `a` with size `n`, members of which will have the value from `1` to `n`. The *k-amazing number* is the smallest number that appears on all contiguous subarrays with size `k` of `a`. If such number doesn't exist, define it as `-1`.

**Trivia**: I was really quick to solve this problem, because it's a complete rip-off from [this Codeforces problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1417/problem/C).

**Solution**: The English editorial for this problem is already in the link above.
