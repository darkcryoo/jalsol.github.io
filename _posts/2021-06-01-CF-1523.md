[Codeforces Deltix Round Spring 2021](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/90915) was held a few days ago. I participated, but didn't write a blog until now.

This round saw my personal best performance at any Codeforces round I have ever taken so far: Performance rating of <span style="color: #a0a">1965</span>.

[<span style="color: black">t</span><span style="color: red">ourist</span>](https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist) went wild this round. He seems to perform really well when the round is big, or it has prizes. He won a **PS5** for being the top 1, solving problems A-E within 20 minutes! [<span style="color: black">R</span><span style="color: red">adewoosh</span>](https://codeforces.com/profile/Radewoosh) broke the 3<span style="color: red">700</span> limit, staying at the top 1 position of the whole website.

Many have criticized the round for various reasons: too confusing statements (C), unoriginal problem (E), weak pretests (A), etc. Perhaps I got such performance because others were down? (lul)

# A. Game of Life
Many high-rated coders failed the system tests, including some <span style="color:red">Grandmasters</span>, despite the problem being very easy.

It can be noticed that a cell can expand at most `n` times, so brute-forcing for `min(m, n)` times is good enough to pass the tests. There are some other `O(n)` solutions, but I think one doesn't have to go through such hassles when `O(n^2)` is good enough.

I misread the problem statement for a few minutes:

```
it has **exactly 1** alive neighbor
```

I was wondering where my brute-force went wrong. Turned out I thought 2 alive neighbors is ok, while it isn't.

# B. Lord of the Values
A fun problem in my opinion. I skimmed through the problem statement and saw that `n` is even. That was it, I had no other ideas. Then I read it again, this time to really understand what the problem wants.

I couldn't find anything else, so I decided to play around with the two operations. I tried solving this small problem first: converting `a` and `b` to `-a` and `-b`. At this point, I understood why `n` has to be even. If this worked with any pair, then the problem would be solved.

I tried many sequences, and I found this:

```
 a     ;  b   (initial)
 a + b ;  b      (1)
 a + b ; -a      (2)
 b     ; -a      (1)
-a + b ; -a      (1)
-a + b ; -b      (2)
-a     ; -b      (1)
```

So, for each pair, by applying the above sequences of operations, `a` and `b` are converted into `-a` and `-b`. Each pair requires 6 operations, so `n`/2 pairs require 6*(`n`/2) operations, which will be 3000 if `n` = 1000, less than 5000.

It's the first time I've solved this kind of constructive algorithms problem, and I am proud of myself.

# C. Compression and Expansion
One of the more controversial problems. Some contestants wanted this round to be unrated, because of this problem.

However, K<span style="color: red">AN</span>, one of the coordinators of this round, decided to keep the round unrated. Many aren't pleased with this decision. (holy shit my performance didn't go to the trashcan)

I got the idea of the solution by looking at the image, which is weird and unusual, but many people seem to agree with me.

Let's set the controversy aside, and go back to the problem. Many people solved this using a stack, but I personally used a static array and a pointer (as that made more sense to me, despite the idea being the same).

If `a[i]` is 1, then the most optimal option is to append this to the end of the current item. Else, traverse the array from the back, until we find an element equal to `a[i] - 1`.

I was surprised to see the 1600 tag, because this is a lot easier in my honest opinion.

# Final words
My performance was really awesome. I tried solving D, but I had no idea at all. Apparently, D requires SOS DP, which I have heard of but never bothered to learn. Many contestants with higher rating than me failed because of FST on A, or because they can't get C.

My rank jumped straight from <span style="color: gray">Newbie</span> to <span style="color: #03a89e">Specialist</span>, which is great, but I'm not satisfied: I want to reach 
<span style="color: blue">Expert</span>. I am still on the new account boost, with 2 contests left. I need to get positive delta, and combined with the +100 boost, I will get the goal.
