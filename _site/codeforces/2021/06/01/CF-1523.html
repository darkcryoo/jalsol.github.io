    <p><a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/90915">Codeforces Deltix Round Spring 2021</a> was held a few days ago. I participated, but didn’t write a blog until now.</p>

<p>This round saw my personal best performance at any Codeforces round I have ever taken so far: Performance rating of <span style="color: #a0a">1965</span>.</p>

<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist"><span style="color: black">t</span><span style="color: red">ourist</span></a> went wild this round. He seems to perform really well when the round is big, or it has prizes. He won a <strong>PS5</strong> just for being the top 1. <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Radewoosh"><span style="color: black">R</span><span style="color: red">adewoosh</span></a> broke the 3<span style="color: red">700</span> limit, staying at the top 1 position of the whole website site.</p>

<p>Many have criticized the round for various reasons: too confusing statements (C), unoriginal problem (E), weak pretests (A), etc. Perhaps I got such performance because others were down? (lul)</p>

<h1 id="a-game-of-life">A. Game of Life</h1>
<p>Many high-rated coders failed the system tests, including some <span style="color:red">Grandmasters</span>, despite the problem being very easy.</p>

<p>It can be noticed that a cell can expand at most <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> times, so brute-forcing for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min(m, n)</code> times is good enough to pass the tests. There are some other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code> solutions, but I think one doesn’t have to go through such hassles when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n^2)</code> is good enough.</p>

<p>I misread the problem statement for a few minutes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>it has **exactly 1** alive neighbor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I was wondering where my brute-force went wrong. Turned out I thought 2 alive neighbors is ok, while it isn’t.</p>

<h1 id="b-lord-of-the-values">B. Lord of the Values</h1>
<p>A fun problem in my opinion. I skimmed through the problem statement and saw that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> is even. That was it, I had no other ideas. Then I read it again, this time to really understand what the problem wants.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find anything else, so I decided to play around with the two operations. I tried solving this small problem first: converting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-b</code>. At this point, I understood why <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> has to be even. If this worked with any pair, then the problem would be solved.</p>

<p>I tried many sequences, and I found this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> a     ;  b   (initial)
 a + b ;  b      (1)
 a + b ; -a      (2)
 b     ; -a      (1)
-a + b ; -a      (1)
-a + b ; -b      (2)
-a     ; -b      (1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, for each pair, by applying the above sequences of operations, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> are converted into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-b</code>. Each pair requires 6 operations, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>/2 pairs require 6*(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>/2) operations, which will be 3000 if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> = 1000, less than 5000.</p>

<p>It’s the first time I’ve solved this kind of constructive algorithms problem, and I am proud of myself.</p>

<h1 id="c-compression-and-expansion">C. Compression and Expansion</h1>
<p>One of the more controversial problems. Some contestants wanted this round to be unrated, because of this problem.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/90915?#comment-797718">
<img src="/assets/CF_1523/1.png" alt="Contestants want round unrated" />
</a></p>

<p>However, K<span style="color: red">AN</span>, one of the coordinators of this round, decided to keep the round unrated. Many aren’t pleased with this decision. (holy shit my performance didn’t go to the trashcan)</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/90915?#comment-797970">
<img src="/assets/CF_1523/2.png" alt="KAN's decision" />
</a></p>

<p>I got the idea of the solution by looking at the image, which is weird and unusual, but many people seem to agree with me.</p>

<p>Let’s set the controversy aside, and go back to the problem. Many people solved this using a stack, but I personally used a static array and a pointer (as that made more sense to me, despite the idea being the same).</p>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a[i]</code> is 1, then the most optimal option is to append this to the end of the current item. Else, traverse the array from the back, until we find an element equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a[i] - 1</code>.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see the 1600 tag, because this is a lot easier in my honest opinion.</p>

<h1 id="final-words">Final words</h1>
<p>My performance was really awesome. I tried solving D, but I had no idea at all. Apparently, D requires SOS DP, which I have heard of but never bothered to learn. Many contestants with higher rating than me failed because of FST on A, or because they can’t get C.</p>

<p>My rank jumped straight from <span style="color: gray">Newbie</span> to <span style="color: #03a89e">Specialist</span>, which is great, but I’m not satisfied: I want to reach 
<span style="color: blue">Expert</span>. I am still on the new account boost, with 2 contests left. I need to get positive delta, and combined with the +100 boost, I will get the goal.</p>
